# UGent Academy Data Management

This project manages data from UGent academies while preserving customizations like logos, colors, and sort orders. The application is fully bilingual (English/Dutch) and displays formatted HTML content from the original sites.

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES

This project now includes all the originally requested features:

âœ… **Full Bilingual Support (EN/NL)** - Django internationalization enabled with comprehensive translations  
âœ… **HTML Content Preservation** - Safely displays formatted HTML from course descriptions  
âœ… **Complete Data Import** - Sessions, dates, and variations properly imported  
âœ… **Image Support** - Offering images scraped and displayed on cards and detail pages  
âœ… **Enhanced UI/UX** - Improved styling, filtering, and navigation  
âœ… **Academy Introductions** - Homepage introduction text scraped and displayed  
âœ… **Teacher Photos & Descriptions** - Full teacher profile information with photos  
âœ… **Smart Filtering** - "Show upcoming only" and category filters work together  
âœ… **UGain Integration** - Automatic post-import migration of UGain offerings  
âœ… **One-Step Operation** - Single command updates everything automatically

## ðŸš€ ONE-STEP OPERATION

**Simply run this single command to get everything:**

```bash
python update_data.py
```

This command will automatically:
1. âœ… **Scrape** all data from academy websites (including images and teacher photos)
2. âœ… **Import** the data into Django database  
3. âœ… **Move** UGain offerings from Science Academy to UGain Academy
4. âœ… **Preserve** all customizations (logos, colors, sort orders)
5. âœ… **Handle** all file locations and dependencies

That's it! No other steps needed.

## Quick Start

### Using the Helper Script (Recommended)
The helper script automates the complete scraping, importing, and post-processing with a single command:

```bash
# Run the complete automated update process (scrape, import, and move UGain offerings)
python update_data.py

# To clear existing data before importing
python update_data.py --clear
```

This single command will:
1. âœ… Scrape data from all academy websites
2. âœ… Import the data into Django database  
3. âœ… Move UGain offerings from Science Academy to UGain Academy
4. âœ… Handle all file locations and dependencies automatically

### Running the Scraper and Import Separately (Manual Process)

If you need more control over each step, you can run them individually:

#### Step 1: Run the Scraper
```bash
# Run the scraper from the project root
python getdata/scrape2.py
# OR
cd getdata
python scrape2.py
```

#### Step 2: Import the Data into Django
```bash
# Import data from the detailed JSON file
python manage.py import_detailed_data getdata/ugent_academies_data_detailed.json

# To clear existing data before import (caution: this removes all existing data)
python manage.py import_detailed_data getdata/ugent_academies_data_detailed.json --clear
```

#### Step 3: Move UGain Offerings
```bash
# Move UGain offerings from Science Academy to UGain Academy
python manage.py move_ugain_offerings
```

### Legacy Methods
These methods are maintained for backward compatibility but using the newer methods above is recommended:

```bash
# Full scrape and import (legacy method)
python manage.py scrape_and_update

# Only scrape (legacy method)
python manage.py scrape_and_update --scrape-only

# Only import from specific JSON file (legacy method)
python manage.py scrape_and_update --import-only --json-file "path/to/data.json"
```

## What Gets Preserved

When you run the update process, the following academy customizations are **preserved**:
- âœ… Academy logos
- âœ… Academy colors (`colour` field)
- âœ… Sort order (`sort_order` field)
- âœ… Academy descriptions
- âœ… Creation timestamps
- âœ… HTML formatting in descriptions and program content

## What Gets Updated

The following data is refreshed from the websites:
- ðŸ”„ All course offerings
- ðŸ”„ Course variations (sessions with specific dates, prices, locations)
- ðŸ”„ Teachers and their profiles
- ðŸ”„ Categories
- ðŸ”„ Languages
- ðŸ”„ Locations
- ðŸ”„ HTML-formatted content (descriptions, program content, remarks)

## How It Works

1. **Export Metadata**: Current academy customizations are exported from the database
2. **Scraping**: The scraper visits all academy websites and collects fresh data
3. **Import with Preservation**: New data is imported while preserving existing customizations
4. **Multilingual Support**: All templates use translation tags to support English and Dutch

## Language Management

### Translation Files
The application uses Django's translation system:
- Translation strings are defined in templates using `{% trans %}` tags
- Messages are extracted to the `.po` file using `python manage.py makemessages -l nl`
- After translation, they are compiled with `python manage.py compilemessages`

### Adding Translations
To update translations after changing templates:
```bash
# Extract new strings to the .po file
python manage.py makemessages -l nl

# Edit the translations in locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

# Compile the translations
python manage.py compilemessages
```

### Language Switching
The application includes a language switcher in the navbar that:
- Sets the user's language preference
- Persists the language choice across sessions
- Automatically switches all content based on the selected language

## Troubleshooting

### Scraper Issues
- Check internet connection
- Verify academy websites are accessible
- Look for scraper output in `getdata/ugent_academies_data_detailed.json`
- If the scraper encounters errors, try running with smaller batches of academies (modify the `academies` list in the script)
- Check HTML formatting in the JSON output to ensure it's being preserved correctly

### File Location Issues
- The scraper (`scrape2.py`) is now configured to save JSON files in the `getdata/` directory
- The `update_data.py` script will automatically check both the root directory and the `getdata/` directory for the JSON file
- If it finds the file in the root directory, it will move it to the correct location automatically
- Always run scripts from the project root directory to ensure correct path resolution

### Import Issues
- Ensure JSON file exists and is valid
- Check Django database connection
- Verify all required models are migrated
- If variations/sessions are not appearing, check:
  - That they exist in the JSON data (look for the "variations" field in offerings)
  - That the import script is correctly processing all variations
  - Run with the `--clear` option to reset all data if necessary

### HTML Content Issues
- If HTML formatting is not displaying correctly, check:
  - That the templates are using the `|safe` filter for fields containing HTML
  - That the HTML content is properly preserved in the JSON file
  - That the import script is not stripping HTML tags

### Session/Date Display Issues
- If sessions/dates are not showing correctly:
  - Check if the variations exist in the JSON data
  - Verify that the variations were properly imported into the database
  - Check the template rendering logic for variations

### Academy Customizations Lost
If customizations were lost, they might be recoverable from:
- Database backups
- Previous JSON exports
- Git history (if tracked)

## Technical Details

### Database Models
- `Academy`: Main academy information with customizations
- `Offering`: Course offerings linked to academies
- `Variation`: Specific course instances with dates/prices
- `Teacher`: Instructor information
- `Category`, `Language`, `Location`: Supporting data

### Scraping Strategy
The scraper (`scrape2.py`) uses multiple selectors to capture:
- Regular course links
- Academic year-specific links (e.g., `/25-26/`, `/24-25/`)
- Category-based navigation
- Pagination handling
- HTML content preservation in descriptions, program content, and remarks
- Session/variation details including dates, teachers, and locations

### Data Preservation
Academy customizations are preserved using Django's `update_or_create()` with the preserved data in the `defaults` parameter, ensuring existing customizations aren't overwritten. HTML formatting in descriptions and content is preserved throughout the import process.

### Multilingual Support
The application supports both English and Dutch:
- Django's internationalization framework is used
- All templates include `{% load i18n %}` and use `{% trans %}` tags
- A language switcher is available in the navbar
- Translations are maintained in `locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`

### HTML Content Handling
- HTML content is preserved during scraping and importing
- Templates use the `|safe` filter when displaying HTML content
- Fields that may contain HTML are documented in the models
- The scraper avoids stripping HTML tags from descriptions and program content

## Future Enhancements

- Automated scheduling (scheduled tasks)
- Change detection and notifications
- Backup/restore functionality
- Web interface for running updates
- Selective academy updates
- Expanded language support
